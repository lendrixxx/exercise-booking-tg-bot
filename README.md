Special thanks to [@SQ77](https://github.com/SQ77) for helping with the deployment 🥳

## Overview

My wife and I found ourselves with a handful of exercise packages across various studios and it was getting troublesome trying to find classes we wanted to go for. That was how this idea was born - to create a telegram bot containing the schedules of all the studios we go to!

## Studios Supported

_Note: Screenshots are not updated to show support for all studios. Usage for different studios are the same._

- Absolute
- Ally
- Anarchy
- Barry's
- Revolution

## Prerequisites

### Environment Variables to set

- BOT_TOKEN
  - To be able to run the bot, you will need to get a bot token from @botfather. FreeCodeCamp has a nice guide [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-telegram-bot-using-python/) that was used as a reference for this project.
- BOOKING_BOT_REV_SECURITY_TOKEN
  - Requests to Hapana (used by Revolution) requires a security token that can be attained by inspecting a request on your browser under the headers.\
